# Travel Dashboard
    After typing in my city and pressing enter
    I am presented with the city's top 5 hotels, restaurants and a 5 day forecast.
    Upon submitting city name.
    It's saved into local storage and displayed in your past searches next time you visit the app.
    When I click a specific restaurant or hotel.
    I am redirected to the hotel or restaurant's website.
    When I click the search button on the city display page.
    A modal where I can input a different city to search for will pop up and you can do the process over again.
